## Hey Everyone! 👋

I am currently a VCU college student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in AI. The main languages I use (and currently enjoy the most) is Java and C#!

When I am not coding I usually watch YouTube videos, play video games, or browse the web for topics that I find interesting.

## Projects 📦
Here are the current projects that I have worked on:
- ???
  - A special project that will be revealed soon!
- [Oranges!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oranges-and-more)
  - Oranges is a Minecraft Mod that adds Oranges to Minecraft, as the name suggests. It has over 500 downloads across differnet Minecraft mod downloading websites! It was one of my first projects and I am really proud of it.
- [Colorful Leaves!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colorful-leaves)
  -  Colorful leaves is another Minecraft mod that I made because I noticed the lack of a mod for such an amazing block in Minecraft! It is actually the more popular mod of the 2 with nearly 4,500 downloads. I am glad so many people has downloaded it so far!
