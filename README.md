## Hey Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a student at VCU pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in AI. The main language I use (and currently enjoy the most) is Java!

When I am not coding I usually watch YouTube videos, playing video games, or doing niche activities that I find enjoyable.

## Projects â˜•
Here is are the current projects that I am working on:
- [Oranges!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oranges-and-more)
  - Oranges is a Minecraft Mod that adds Oranges to Minecraft, as the name suggests. It has nearly 500 downloads across differnet Minecraft mod downloading websites! It was one of my first projects and I am really proud of it.
- [Colorful Leaves!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colorful-leaves)
  -  Colorful leaves is another Minecraft mod that I made because I noticed the lack of a mod for such an amazing block in Minecraft! It is actually the more popular mod of the 2 and I am glad so many people has downloaded it so far!
